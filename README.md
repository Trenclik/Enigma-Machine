# Enigma-Machine

The Enigma machines were a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- to mid-twentieth century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication.

## Task

* Simulate a simplified Version of the Enigma encryption machine
* The rotors are:

    Rotor 50: 
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    
    Rotor 51: 
    ADCBEHFGILJKMPNOQTRSUXVWZY
    
    Rotor 60: 
    ACEDFHGIKJLNMOQPRTSUWVXZYB
    
    Rotor 61: 
    AZXVTRPNDJHFLBYWUSQOMKIGEC
    
    Rotor 70: 
    AZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCB
    
    Rotor 71: 
    AEBCDFJGHIKOLMNPTQRSUYVWXZ

* Test your simulation with the rotors 71, 60, 51, the key 'SEC' and by encrypting 'ICANDOTHAT'. The result is expected to be 'RBLSPTYYLP'.
* Test your simulation with the rotors 61, 50, 70, the key 'AIN' and by decrypting 'ZJWNFNFNJ'. If your simulation works correctly, you will know from the decrypted result
